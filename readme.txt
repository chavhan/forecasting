Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
airline_forecast - Script file in R language 
airline_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on airline dataset
Airline_Dataset_Description - inferences on airline datset and driven approach and other describtion 
total_res- result image which is having figures of results on different parameter 
cocacola_forecast - Script file in R language 
cocacola_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on cocacola dataset
Forecasting_plot_graphs  - inferences on airline datset and driven approach and other describtion on cocacola dataset
total_res- result image which is having figures of results on different parameter

objective:- 
Forecast the CocaCola prices and Airlines Passengers data set. Prepare a document for each model explaining 
how many dummy variables you have 
created and RMSE value for each model. Finally which model you will use for 
Forecasting.


Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using R or Python.
